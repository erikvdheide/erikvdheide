### 👋 Hi there! 

👤 My name is **Erik van der Heide**, 

🎓 I have a study background in Econometrics & Operations Reseach, therefore

➗ I like to solve applied math and data science problems,

🚚 in areas such as logistics, retail, energy and health care.

💻 During my studies I have learned to work with programming languages,

🐍 such as Java, Python, R, MATLAB and AIMMS.

😄 I'd like to keep developing myself in this area with interesting and meaningful projects!
